# Compress Cube Example
There are 2 decks simulating the compression of a cube using a prescribed top
face displacement condition using a (1) explicit and (2) implicit solver.  The
simulations are equivalent except for the solver type (and the properly
simulated transient response associated with the explicit solver.  

``run.py`` has example syntax to run through mesh generation, generating
boundary and initial conditions, running the simulation and extracting
post-processing results.
