LSTC I/O Library file format

The file consists of a header followed by a number of records.  The general
format for a data record is:

	length field
	command field
	command specific data

The length field gives the total number of bytes in the record, including
the length field itself.

The command field is a tag which determines the contents and format
of the rest of the data record.


The header is a series of bytes having the following meanings:

byte
  0 = number of bytes in the header.  Currently this is 8.
  1 = number of bytes used in record LENGTH fields
  2 = number of bytes used in record OFFSET fields
  3 = number of bytes used in record COMMAND fields
  4 = number of bytes used in record TYPEID fields
  5 = big-endian flag: 0 = big-endian, 1 = little-endian
  6 = floating point format flag: 0 = IEEE
  7 = currently unused

Immediately after the header is a record of type SYMBOLTABLEOFFSET.
Then any number of CD and DATA records follow.  After any
record in the remainder of the file, there may be symbol table information.
The symbol table information begins with a record of type BEGINSYMBOLTABLE,
ends with a record of type ENDSYMBOLTABLE, with only records of type
CD or VARIABLE between the two.

The details of each record type are as follows:

NULL: LENGTH field, COMMAND field, empty
	LENGTH  = length of this record
	COMMAND = LSDA_NULL
	empty   = meaningless data.  This allows for some amount
                  of data to be deleted from the file -- for example
                  corrupt symbol table data.
CD: LENGTH field, COMMAND field, Path.
	LENGTH  = length of this record
	COMMAND = LSDA_CD
	Path    = non-terminated ascii string giving the new current
	          directory path.  It may be absolute or relative.

DATA: LENGTH field, COMMAND field, TYPEID field, Name length, Name, Data
	LENGTH  = length of this record
	COMMAND = LSDA_DATA
	TYPEID  = integer representing the type of data (see TYPES below)
	Name length = 1 byte giving the length of the variable name
	Name    = non-terminated ascii string giving the variable name
	Data    = data contained in the variable

BEGINSYMBOLTABLE: LENGTH field, COMMAND field
	LENGTH  = TOTAL length of the symbol table in bytes
	COMMAND = LSDA_BEGINSYMBOLTABLE

ENDSYMBOLTABLE: LENGTH field, COMMAND field, OFFSET field
	LENGTH  = length of this record
	COMMAND = LSDA_ENDSYMBOLTABLE
        OFFSET  = byte offset in file of next part of symbol table, or 0

VARIABLE: LENGTH field, COMMAND field, Name, TYPEID field,
	  OFFSET field, LENGTH field
	LENGTH  = length of this record
	COMMAND = LSDA_VARIABLE
	Name    = non-terminated ascii string giving the variable name
	TYPEID  = integer representing the type of data (see TYPES below)
        OFFSET  = byte offset in file of the DATA record for this variable.
	LENGTH  = number of variables of type (TYPEID) written
	          (NOT number of bytes!)

Defined constants:

	LSDA_NULL                 = 1
	LSDA_CD                   = 2
	LSDA_DATA                 = 3
	LSDA_VARIABLE             = 4
	LSDA_BEGINSYMBOLTABLE     = 5
	LSDA_ENDSYMBOLTABLE       = 6
	LSDA_SYMBOLTABLEOFFSET    = 7

Data Types:

There are 10 predefined data types that can exist in the file:

I*1, I*2, I*4, I*8  =  length specific signed integers
U*1, U*2, U*4, U*8  =  length specific unsigned integers
R*4, R*8            =  length specific floating point numbers

They have type ids as follows:

	I*1 = 1
	I*2 = 2
	I*4 = 3
	I*8 = 4
	U*1 = 5
	U*2 = 6
	U*4 = 7
	U*8 = 8
	R*4 = 9
	R*8 = 10
